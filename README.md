# Antboy-Gameboy-Emulator
This project is my AQA Computer Science NEA submission. As a long-time fan of classic Gameboy games like *Tetris DX*, *F-1 Race* and *Super Mario Land*, I aimed to create a Gameboy emulator that provides a smooth and enjoyable experience while also challenging myself with a complex but rewarding programming task.
